<h1>Breakout! C + OpenGl Version</h1>
<h4>A small file size implementation of the arcade game breakout using C and Glut (OpenGl Utility Toolkit).</h4>
<h4>Works for both Linux with some resolution issues in windows. Will need to be compiled with: "gcc main.c -o main -lm -lGL -lGLU -lglut" and have miniaudio.h in same dir as main.cpp</h4>
